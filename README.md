## How is this possible ❓

Institutions move markets with massive orders, but retail traders like us can still spot their footprints and ride along for some smart profits 😉:

💡 𝗢𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗕𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸𝘀: Financial institutions split their huge orders into smaller chunks so that they get their orders filled at better prices. Price of the asset often revisits these levels, giving us a chance to enter.

💡 𝗙𝗮𝗶𝗿 𝗩𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲 𝗚𝗮𝗽𝘀 (𝗙𝗩𝗚𝘀): The sudden price jump from such large orders create a hole in the market that price has to come back and “fill” – a repeatable edge.

💡 𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸 𝗼𝗳 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 (𝗕𝗢𝗦): When price smashes through a key order block zone, it often signals the start of a new trend.

## ✨ Features

* **3 Strategy Modes**: Order Blocks (OB), Fair Value Gaps (FVG), Break of Structure (BOS), or Auto (combines all).
* **Adaptive Volatility Filters**: ATR-driven displacement & FVG sizing.
* **Session Filter**: Skips Asian session, focuses on London & New York.
* **Regime Detection**: ADX or Efficiency Ratio to trade only in trending markets.
* **Equity Bagging System**: Automatically locks profits and caps losses at account equity levels.
* **Flexible Risk Management**: Position sizing per \$1,000 balance, ATR-based SL/TP.
